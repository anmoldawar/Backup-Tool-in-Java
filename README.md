# Backup-Tool-in-Java
Implemented a backup tool using the Visitor and Observer Pattern. The Input file is read word by word and the words are stored in a Binary Search Tree. If the word is already present, its frequency value is incremented , else it is stored as a new node of the tree. Next, deep copy of the original tree is performed node by node. The observer pattern is set during the cloning process such that if any node's value is changed , the corresponding node of the backup tree is also changed. PopulateVisitor reads the input file and stores the words in BST. WordCountVisitor traverses the tree and counts the words. CloneObserve clones the original tree and sets up the Observer Pattern.
